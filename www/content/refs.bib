	of proliferation of new species (species diversification) and rates
	of morphological divergence between them. However, this relationship
	has not been rigorously tested using phylogeny-based approaches.
	Here, we test this relationship with morphological and phylogenetic
	data from 190 species of plethodontid salamanders. Surprisingly,
	we find that rates of species diversification and morphological evolution
	are not significantly correlated, such that rapid diversification
	can occur with little morphological change, and vice versa. We also
	find that most clades have undergone remarkably similar patterns
	of morphological evolution (despite extensive sympatry) and that
	those relatively novel phenotypes are not associated with rapid diversification.
	Finally, we find a strong relationship between rates of size and
	shape evolution, which has not been previously tested.},

  abstract = {The material properties of bone can vary considerably among skeletal
	elements from different parts of the body that serve different functions.
	However, functional demands placed on a specific type of skeletal
	element also can vary at a variety of scales, such as between different
	parts of the element, among individuals of a species, and across
	species. Variation in bone material properties might be correlated
	with differing functional demands at any of these scales. In this
	study we performed three-point bending tests on bone specimens extracted
	from antlers of moose (Alces alces) to test for three types of variation
	in bone material stiffness (Young's modulus): within the antler structure,
	between populations of moose, and between moose and other deer species.
	Because superficial portions of the antler are exposed to greater
	bending stress and strain than deeper portions, and because the antler
	beam (the basal shaft that attaches to the skull) is subjected to
	greater bending moments than more distal parts of the antler, we
	predicted that superficial bone and bone from the beam would be stiffer
	than bone from other parts of the antler. Instead, we identified
	no significant differences in these comparisons. There were also
	no significant differences in antler stiffness between moose from
	Michigan and the Yukon, even though the rapid growth required of
	antlers from northern latitudes like the Yukon has the potential
	to compromise bone material properties. However, moose have significantly
	stiffer antlers (11.6 +/- 0.45 GPa, mean +/- SE) than any other deer
	in the odocoileine lineage. Moreover, phylogenetic reconstructions
	of the evolution of antler stiffness in deer indicate a strong potential
	that high antler stiffness is a derived feature of moose. The unusual
	palmate shape of moose antlers likely subjects their antler beams
	to higher bending moments than found in other odocoileines, a factor
	that may have contributed to the evolutionary divergence of moose
	antler stiffness from that of other members of this clade. Although
	similarities in the mineral composition of bone across species likely
	limit the overall range of phylogenetic variation in bone material
	properties, our results demonstrate that evolutionary diversity in
	bone material properties can show correspondence with phylogenetic

	We explain and develop a method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
	process, first proposed by Hansen. OU models incorporate both selection
	and drift and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general
	than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,
	OU models possess selective optima which formalize the notion of

	hypotheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into
	explicit models, test the models against data using maximum-likelihood-based
	model-selection techniques, and infer details of the evolutionary
	process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples.
	
	
	Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we demonstrate
	allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to utilize more
	of the information content of comparative datasets than existing

	operating differently on the body sizes of males and females. Anolis
	lizard species of the Greater Antilles have been classified into
	ecomorph classes, largely on the basis of their structural habitat
	(perch height and diameter). We show that the major ecomorph classes
	differ in degree of SSD. At least two SSD classes are supported:
	high SSD (trunk-crown, trunk-ground) and low SSD (trunk, crown-giant,
	grass-bush, twig). Differences cannot be attributed to an allometric
	increase of SSD with body size or to a phylogenetic effect. A third
	explanation, that selective pressures on male and/or female body
	size vary among habitat types, is examined by evaluating expectations
	from the major relevant kinds of selective pressures. Although no
	one kind of selective pressure produces expectations consistent with
	all of the information, competition with respect to structural habitat
	and sexual selection pressures are more likely possibilities than
	competition with respect to prey size or optimal feeding pressures.
	The existence of habitat-specific sexual dimorphism suggests that

	It is important to note that the components of shape analyzed in
	these studies is related to locomotion and are size-adjusted, including:
	relative limb and body lengths and mass of the body. Numbers of lamellae
	were also used and these do not vary with size. Furthermore, dimorphism
	in both size and shape differs by habitat type. Thus, does functionally-relevant
	sexual dimorphism imply that one sex is the "ecological" sex, with
	the other being maladapted to it's environment? Alternatively, sexual
	dimorphism may interact with adaptive diversification. Different
	classes of individuals within a species may act as separate ecological
	units if they play ecologically different roles. Here, I reanalyze
	a data set of morphological data for 15 species of Puerto Rican and

	radiations of lizards. I test for concordance between size and shape
	dimorphism and microhabitat (ecomorph) type, and for "parallel" patterns

	in the light of previous research, evaluate the relative influence

  abstract = {The problem of gradual versus punctuated change within phyletic lineages
	can be understood in terms of the homogeneity of evolutionary dynamics.
	Hypotheses of punctuated change imply that the rules governing evolutionary
	change shift over time such that the normal dynamics of stasis are
	temporarily suspended, permitting a period of net evolutionary change.
	Such explanations are members of a larger class of models in which
	evolutionary dynamics are in some way heterogeneous over time. In
	this paper, I develop a likelihood-based statistical framework to
	evaluate the support for this kind of evolutionary model. This approach
	divides evolutionary sequences into nonoverlapping segments, each
	of which is fit to a separate evolutionary model. Models with heterogeneous
	dynamics are generally more complex-they require more parameters
	to specify-than uniform evolutionary models such as random walks
	and stasis. The Akaike Information Criterion can be used to judge
	whether the greater complexity of punctuational models is offset
	by a sufficient gain in log-likelihood for these models to be preferred.
	I use this approach to analyze three case studies for which punctuational
	explanations have been proposed. In the first, a model of punctuated
	evolution best accounted for changes in pygidial morphology within
	a lineage of the trilobite Flexicalymene, but the uniform model of
	an unbiased random walk remains a plausible alternative. Body size
	evolution in the radiolarian Pseudocubus vema was neither purely
	gradual nor completely pulsed. Instead, the best-supported explanation
	posited a single, pulsed increase, followed later by a shift to an
	unbiased random walk. Finally, for the much-analyzed claim of "punctuated
	gradualism" in the foraminifera Globorotalia, the best-supported
	model implied two periods of stasis separated by a period of elevated
	but not inherently directional evolution. Although the conclusions
	supported by these analyses generally refined rather than overturned
	previous views, the present approach differs from those prior in
	that all competing interpretations were formalized into explicit
	statistical models, allowing their relative support to be unambiguously

	isolated clades inhabiting similar selective regimeswill diversify
	to create similar sets of phenotypes in different locations (e.g.,
	similar stickleback species in different lakes, similar Anolis ecomorphs
	on different islands). Such parallel radiations are not generally
	expected to occur in sympatry because the available niche space would
	be filled by whichever clade is diversified first. Here, we document
	a very different pattern, the parallel evolution of similar body-size
	morphs in three sympatric clades of plethodontid salamanders (Desmognathus,
	Plethodon, Spelerpinae) in eastern North America. Using a comprehensive,
	time-calibrated phylogeny of North American plethodontids from nuclear
	and mitochondrial DNA sequences, we show that these three clades
	have undergone replicated patterns of evolution in body size and
	that this parallel diversification occurred in broad-scale sympatry.
	At the local scale, we find that coexisting species from these clades
	are more similar in body size than expected under a null model in
	which species are randomly assembled into communities. These patterns
	are particularly surprising in that competition is known to be important
	in driving phenotypic diversification and limiting local coexistence
	of similar-sized species within these clades. Although parallel diversification
	of sympatric clades may seem counterintuitive, we discuss several
	ecological and evolutionary factors that may allow the phenomenon

	Although there was only weak support for a shift at the base of a
	second tropical clade, where the observed nucleotide substitution
	rate is high, overall support for a shift in environmental conditions
	at cladogenesis is very strong. This suggests that speciation in
	some lichen clades has proceeded by dispersal into a novel environment,
	followed by radiation within that environment. We found moderate
	support for a shift in moisture regime at the base of one tropical

  abstract = {Aim: Provide a new multivariate hypothesis testing approach for the
	evolution of continuous characters in a phylogenetic context. Background:
	Brownian motion is the most commonly used model for the evolution
	of quantitative traits. Under multivariate Brownian motion, the evolution
	of multiple continuous traits can be described by an evolutionary
	rate matrix in which the diagonal elements determine the rate of
	evolution for individual characters, while the off-diagonal elements
	determine the extent to which different characters co-evolve. Method:
	We present likelihood tests for two simple hypotheses about the evolutionary
	rate matrix: (1) equality or proportionality to a hypothetical matrix;
	and (2) concerted change in the rate matrix in a certain portion
	or portions of the phylogenetic tree. In case (1), the hypothetical
	matrix might be estimated from the within-species additive genetic
	variance-covariance matrix. In case (2), concerted change in the
	evolutionary rate matrix might result from shifts in ploidy level
	or the mutation rate. We illustrate these hypothesis tests using
	data from individual-based quantitative genetic simulations on stochastic
	phylogenetic trees. Results: Our evolutionary rate matrix estimator
	exhibited minimal bias. Type I errors in our likelihood-based tests
	for matrix equality and proportionality were very close to appropriate
	levels. Power to detect selection was also sufficient, except in
	the case of the weakest selection simulated in this study. Type I
	error and the accuracy of parameter estimation in the test for rate
	matrix heterogeneity were also adequate.},

	signal" in data sets composed of observations collected from species
	related by a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic signal is a measure
	of the statistical dependence among species' trait values due to
	their phylogenetic relationships. Although phylogenetic signal is
	a measure of pattern (statistical dependence), there has nonetheless
	been a widespread propensity in the literature to attribute this
	pattern to aspects of the evolutionary process or rate. This may
	be due, in part, to the perception that high evolutionary rate necessarily
	results in low phylogenetic signal; and, conversely, that low evolutionary
	rate or stabilizing selection results in high phylogenetic signal
	(due to the resulting high resemblance between related species).
	In this study, we use individual-based numerical simulations on stochastic
	phylogenetic trees to clarify the relationship between phylogenetic
	signal, rate, and evolutionary process. Under the simplest model
	for quantitative trait evolution, homogeneous rate genetic drift,
	there is no relation between evolutionary rate and phylogenetic signal.
	For other circumstances, such as functional constraint, fluctuating

	when evolutionary lineages diverge simultaneously by genetic drift,
	the pattern of among-population divergence will parallel the pattern
	of within-population genetic variation and covariation. Among-population
	divergence is measured by the variance-covariance matrix of population
	means (the D matrix), or by the variance-covariance matrix of independent
	contrasts (D-IC). The latter avoids the assumption of simultaneous
	divergence by incorporating phylogenetic non-independence among lineages
	and was developed expressly for this study. Within-population genetic
	variation and covariation are measured by the additive genetic variance-covariance
	matrix (the G matrix). Organism: The Puerto Rican crested anole (Anolis
	cristatellus). Methods: We sampled A. cristatellus from seven divergent
	populations widely dispersed across the species' range. These populations
	are sufficiently highly diverged to be considered evolutionarily
	independent lineages. We substituted the phenotypic variance-covariance
	matrix (P matrix) for G in evolutionary analysis. (Empirical studies
	have shown that P and G are frequently highly correlated for morphological
	traits.) In two populations, we estimated phenotypic variance-covariance
	matrices (P matrices) for 13 skeletal morphological traits, while
	in the remaining five we estimated mean phenotypes for the same traits.
	To test the hypothesis of constraint, we first calculated a pooled
	phenotypic variance-covariance matrix ((P) over bar) from all populations.
	We compared (P) over bar to the variance-covariance matrix of population
	means (D) and of independent contrasts (D-IC). Independent contrasts
	were calculated using a molecular phylogeny of the included lineages.
	Results: Comparison of P matrices between populations showed evidence
	that covariance structure is highly conserved in conspecific populations
	of A. cristatellus. Comparison of (P) over bar with D and of (P)
	over bar with D-IC indicated significant similarity in both cases,

  abstract = {The bipedal posture (BP) and gait of humans are unique evolutionary
	hallmarks, but similar stances and forms of locomotion have had enormous
	influences on a range of phylogenetically diverse tetrapods, particularly
	dinosaurs and birds, and a range of mammalian lineages, including
	non-human apes. The complex movements involved in bipedalism appear
	to have modest evolutionary origins, and it is presumed that a stable
	and erect posture is a prerequisite for erect strides and other bipedal
	movements. Facultative bipedalism in several lineages of lizards
	is achieved by running, but some varanid lizards (genus Varanus)
	exhibit BPs without running. In these cases, BPs (BPstanding) are
	not used as a form of locomotion; rather, BPstanding is associated
	with defensive displays, and such postures also probably permit better
	inspection of the environment. Yet, in other varanids, BPs have been
	observed only during combat episodes (BPcombat), where both contestants
	rise together and embrace in the so-called clinch phase. Numerous
	other species, however, show neither type of BP. Past researchers
	have commented that only large-bodied varanids exhibit BP, a behaviour
	that appears to show phylogenetic trends. We termed this idea the
	King-Green-Pianka (KGP) bipedal hypothesis. In this article, we address
	two main questions derived from the KGP hypothesis. First, what is
	the phylogenetic distribution of BP in Varanus and close relatives
	(varanoids)? Second, is BP positively correlated with the phylogenetic
	distribution of large body size (e.g. snout-vent length, SVL)? In
	addition, we asked a related question: do the lengths of the femur
	and tail show body size-independent adaptive trends in association
	with BP? Because varanid species that show BPstanding also use these
	postures during combat (BPcombat), both types of BP were analysed
	collectively and simply termed BP. Using comparative phylogenetic
	analyses, the reconstruction of BP required three steps, involving
	a single gain and two losses. Specifically, BP was widespread in
	the monophyletic Varanus, and the single gain occurred at the most
	recent common ancestor of the African clade. The two losses of BP
	occurred in different clades (Indo-Asian B clade and Indo-Australian
	Odatria clade). BPs are absent in the sister group to Varanus (Lanthanotus
	borneensis) and the other outgroup species (Heloderma spp.). Our
	phylogenetic reconstruction supports the KGP prediction that BP is
	restricted to large-bodied taxa. Using the Hansen model of adaptive
	evolution on a limited, but highly relevant morphological dataset
	(i.e. SVL; femur length, FL; tail length, TL), we demonstrated that
	these characters were not equivalent in their contribution to the
	evolution of BP in Varanus. SVL was significantly correlated with
	BP when modelled in a phylogenetic context, but the model identified
	random processes as dominant over adaptive evolution, suggesting
	that a body size threshold might be involved in the evolution of
	BP. A Brownian motion (BM) model outperformed the selection model
	in our analysis of relative TL, suggesting that TL and BP evolved
	independently. The selection model for relative FL outperformed the
	BM model, indicating that FL and BP share an adaptive history. Our
	non-phylogenetic analyses involving regression residuals of FL and
	TL vs. SVL showed no significant correlation between these characters
	and BP. We suggest that BP in Varanus provides a convergent or analogue
	model from which to investigate various forms of bipedalism in tetrapod
	vertebrate, especially other reptiles, such as theropod dinosaurs.
	Because BPstanding in varanids is possibly an incipient stage to
	some form of upright locomotion, its inclusion as a general model
	in evolutionary analyses of bipedalism of vertebrates will probably
	provide novel and important insights. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society

	dispersal abilities and non-random patterns of site occupancy. Core
	and satellite species also differed in patterns of relative abundance.
	The core group followed a lognormal distribution, the satellite group
	a power function as predicted by the self-similarity model of occurrence.
	We conclude that the division into core and satellite species is
	not a sample artefact but reflects different life history strategies.
	We also conclude that current models of niche division and co-occurrence
	might miss important aspects of community structure if they do not
	refer to patterns of dispersal. From these findings we infer that
	the regional distribution of core species might be shaped by species
	interactions and processes of niche divisions whereas the spatial
	distribution of satellite species are best interpreted as stemming
	from random dispersal.},

  abstract = {One of the most important floristic sorting periods to affect modern
	plant communities occurred during the shift from the wet Tertiary
	period to the unusually dry Quaternary, when most global deserts
	developed. During this time, a wave of new plant species emerged,
	presumably in response to the new climate. Interestingly, most Tertiary
	species that have been tracked through the fossil record did not
	disappear but remained relatively abundant despite the development
	of a much more unfavorable climate for species adapted to moist conditions.
	Here we find, by integrating paleobotanical, ecological, and phylogenetic
	analyses, that a large number of ancient Tertiary species in Mediterranean-climate
	ecosystems appear to have been preserved by the facilitative or "nurse"
	effects of modern Quaternary species. Our results indicate that these
	interdependent relationships among plants have played a central role
	in the preservation of the global biodiversity and provided a mechanism
	for stabilizing selection and the conservation of ecological traits

	comparative study to test whether correlations between habitat and

	from south-eastern Australia in the families Hylidae and Myobatrachidae.
	Habitat distributions and phylogenetic relationships were compiled
	from the literature and shape was quantified using geometric morphometric
	analysis of published drawings. Results indicate that shape evolved
	towards different optima in different habitats while also showing
	appreciable levels of phylogenetic inertia. Within myobatrachids,
	evolution of terrestrial tadpoles was associated with a short and
	shallow head/body and a shallow tail. In aquatic species, the use
	of benthic microhabitats was correlated with a long shallow tail,
	dorsal eye position, shallow head/body and ventral mouth with robust
	jaw sheaths. Even traits with evidence for adaptation evolved slowly
	in response to habitat shifts, usually requiring >= 10 million years
	to evolve half-way to a new optimum. Although these findings support
	adaptive evolution of tadpole body form, they also highlight a strong

	Breeding systems, hypothesized to indicate different levels of mating

	different optima of inflorescence size. Larger inflorescences, which
	increase male fitness by generating larger floral displays, were
	hypothesized to be selected under scenarios with higher competition
	with unisexuals. An identical approach was used to test if the same
	selective regimes could be driving the evolution of leaf size, a
	vegetative trait that was found to be correlated with inflorescence
	size. A Brownian motion model of inflorescence/leaf-size evolution
	(which cannot distinguish between changes caused by pure drift processes
	and changes caused by natural selection in rapidly and randomly changing
	environments) was compared with several adaptive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
	(OU) models, which can quantify the effects of both stochasticity
	and natural selection. The best-fitting model for inflorescence/leaf-size
	evolution was an OU model with three optima that increased with the
	level of mating competition. Both traits evolved under the same selective
	regimes and in the same direction, confirming a pattern of correlated

	Recently, there has been disagreement about how often, if ever, this

	differences in the statistical tests employed. This study shows,
	how different tests of the island rule assume different null hypotheses,

	Many widely used tests are shown to yield false support for the island

	so a Monte Carlo permutation test is introduced that avoids this
	problem. It is further shown that tests based on independent contrasts
	lack power to detect the island rule under certain conditions. Finally,
	a complete reanalysis is presented of recent data from primates.
	When head-body length is used as the measure of body size, reports
	of the island rule are shown to stem from methodological artefacts.
	But when skull length or body mass are used, all tests agree that

  abstract = {Directional evolutionary trends have long garnered interest because
	they suggest that evolution can be predictable. However, the identification
	of the trends themselves and the underlying processes that may produce
	them have often been controversial(1). In 1862, in explaining the
	exceptionally long nectar spur of Angraecum sesquipedale, Darwin
	proposed that a coevolutionary 'race' had driven the directional
	increase in length of a plant's spur and its pollinator's tongue(2).
	Thus he predicted the existence of an exceptionally long-tongued
	moth. Though the discovery of Xanthopan morgani ssp. praedicta in
	1903 with a tongue length of 22 cm validated Darwin's prediction(3),
	his 'race' model for the evolution of long-spurred flowers remains
	contentious(4). Spurs may also evolve to exceptional lengths by way
	of pollinator shifts as plants adapt to a series of unrelated pollinators,
	each with a greater tongue length(5). Here, using a species-level
	phylogeny of the columbine genus, Aquilegia, we show a significant
	evolutionary trend for increasing spur length during directional
	shifts to pollinators with longer tongues. In addition, we find evidence
	for 'punctuated' change in spur length during speciation events(6),
	suggesting that Aquilegia nectar spurs rapidly evolve to fit adaptive
	peaks predefined by pollinator morphology. These findings show that
	evolution may proceed in predictable pathways without reversals and
	that change may be concentrated during speciation.},

  title = {Phylogenetic comparative analysis: a modeling approach for adaptive
	evolution},
  journal = {American Naturalist},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {164},
  pages = {683--695.},
  abstract = {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to study adaptive
	evolution. However, none of the popular methods model selection directly.
	We explain and develop a method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
	process, first proposed by Hansen. OU models incorporate both selection
	and drift and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general
	than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,
	OU models possess selective optima which formalize the notion of
	adaptive zone. In this paper, we develop the method for one quantitative
	character, discuss interpretations of its parameters, and provide
	code implementing the method. Our approach allows us to translate
	hypotheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into
	explicit models, test the models against data using maximum-likelihood-based
	model-selection techniques, and infer details of the evolutionary
	process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples.
	
	
	Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we demonstrate
	allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to utilize more
	of the information content of comparative datasets than existing
	methods. Moreover, the use of a model selection framework to simultaneously
	compare a variety of hypotheses advances our ability to assess alternative
	evolutionary explanations.},

	{Greater} {Antillean} {Anolis} Lizards},
  journal = {Evolution},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {54},
  pages = {259--272},
  abstract = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is the evolutionary result of selection
	operating differently on the body sizes of males and females. Anolis
	lizard species of the Greater Antilles have been classified into
	ecomorph classes, largely on the basis of their structural habitat
	(perch height and diameter). We show that the major ecomorph classes
	differ in degree of SSD. At least two SSD classes are supported:
	high SSD (trunk-crown, trunk-ground) and low SSD (trunk, crown-giant,
	grass-bush, twig). Differences cannot be attributed to an allometric
	increase of SSD with body size or to a phylogenetic effect. A third
	explanation, that selective pressures on male and/or female body
	size vary among habitat types, is examined by evaluating expectations
	from the major relevant kinds of selective pressures. Although no
	one kind of selective pressure produces expectations consistent with
	all of the information, competition with respect to structural habitat
	and sexual selection pressures are more likely possibilities than
	competition with respect to prey size or optimal feeding pressures.
	The existence of habitat-specific sexual dimorphism suggests that
	adaptation of Anolis species to their environment is more complex
	than previously appreciated.}

  abstract = {Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes, or
	between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried out
	by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation, and
	contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume
	that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution.
	When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly
	nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence
	will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests.
	Some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and
	limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence
	have been discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has
	been proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and
	the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters
	to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions,
	the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, contrasts
	that are statistically independent and can be used in regression
	or correlation studies. The considerable barriers to making practical
	use of this technique have been discussed.},

  volume = {208},
  pages = {3015--3035},
  abstract = {Over the past two decades, comparative biological analyses have undergone
	profound changes with the incorporation of rigorous evolutionary
	perspectives and phylogenetic information. This change followed in
	large part from the realization that traditional methods of statistical
	analysis tacitly assumed independence of all observations, when in
	fact biological groups such as species are differentially related
	to each other according to their evolutionary history. New phylogenetically
	based analytical methods were then rapidly developed, incorporated
	into ;the comparative method', and applied to many physiological,
	biochemical, morphological and behavioral investigations. We now
	review the rationale for including phylogenetic information in comparative
	studies and briefly discuss three methods for doing this (independent
	contrasts, generalized least-squares models, and Monte Carlo computer
	simulations). We discuss when and how to use phylogenetic information
	in comparative studies and provide several examples in which it has
	been helpful, or even crucial, to a comparative analysis. We also
	consider some difficulties with phylogenetically based statistical
	methods, and of comparative approaches in general, both practical
	and theoretical. It is our personal opinion that the incorporation
	of phylogeny information into comparative studies has been highly
	beneficial, not only because it can improve the reliability of statistical
	inferences, but also because it continually emphasizes the potential
	importance of past evolutionary history in determining current form
	and function.},

  volume = {51},
  pages = {1341--1351},
  abstract = {Comparative studies tend to differ from optimality and functionality
	studies in how they treat adaptation. While the comparative approach
	focuses on the origin and change of traits, optimality studies assume
	that adaptations are maintained at an optimum by stabilizing selection.
	This paper presents a model of adaptive evolution on a macroevolutionary
	time scale that includes the maintenance of traits at adaptive optima
	by stabilizing selection as the dominant evolutionary force. Interspecific
	variation is treated as variation in the position of adaptive optima.
	The model illustrates how phylogenetic constraints nor only lead
	to correlations between phylogenetically related species, but also
	to imperfect adaptations. From this model, a statistical comparative
	method is derived that can be used to estimate the effect of a selective
	factor on adaptive optima in a way that would be consistent with
	an optimality study of adaptation to this factor. The method is illustrated
	with an analysis of dental evolution in fossil horses. The use of
	comparative methods to study evolutionary trends is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary processes shape the regular trends of evolution and are
	responsible for the diversity and distribution of contemporary species.
	They include correlated evolutionary change and trajectories of trail
	evolution, convergent and parallel evolution, differential rates
	of evolution, speciation and extinction, the order and direction
	of change in characters, and the nature of the evolutionary process
	itself - does change accumulate gradually, episodically, or in punctuational
	bursts. Phylogenies, in combination with information on species,
	contain the imprint of these historical evolutionary processes. By
	applying comparative methods based upon statistical models of evolution
	to well resolved phylogenies, it is possible to infer the historical
	evolutionary processes that must have existed in the past, given
	the patterns of diversity seen in the present. I describe a set of
	maximum likelihood statistical methods for inferring such processes.
	The methods estimate parameters of statistical models for inferring
	correlated evolutionary change in continuously varying characters,
	for detecting correlated evolution in discrete characters, for estimating
	rates of evolution, and for investigating the nature of the evolutionary
	process itself. They also anticipate the wealth of information becoming
	available to biological scientists from genetic studies that pin
	down relationships among organisms with unprecedented accuracy. (C)

  abstract = {Despite its role in whole-animal performance, the adaptation of muscle
	physiology related to terrestrial locomotion remains underexplored.
	We tested evolutionary models based on predator escape and foraging
	strategies of lizards to assess whether fiber-type composition of
	a leg muscle is adaptive for behavior. The best-fitting model for
	fast-twitch fiber-type evolution was one based on predator-escape
	strategy, while the foraging-mode model fared poorly (Akaike Information
	Criterion with small sample size correction; $\Delta \mathrm{AICc}\,=29.7$
	). According to the predator-escape model, lizards relying on sprints
	to avoid predators are predicted to have relatively higher proportions
	of fast glycolytic (FG) fibers (70%), while cryptic lizards are predicted
	to have relatively higher fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG) fiber proportions
	(77%). This pattern suggests an evolutionary trend toward greater
	FG (FOG) fiber composition among lizards that specialize in sprinting
	(crypsis). The best-fitting model for slow-twitch fibers had a single
	optimum, suggesting a common selective pressure across these lizards.
	The second-best model explaining slow-twitch fiber-type evolution
	was Brownian motion ( $\Delta \mathrm{AICc}\,=0.80$ ), indicating
	some support for neutral evolution. We find evidence suggesting that
	different fiber types occurring in the same muscle can evolve under
	different evolutionary pressures.},

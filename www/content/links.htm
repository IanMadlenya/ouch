    <dd>Mesquite is software for evolutionary biology, designed to
    help biologists analyze comparative data about organisms. Its
    emphasis is on phylogenetic analysis, but some of its modules
    concern population genetics, while others
    do&nbsp;non-phylogenetic multivariate analysis. Because it is
    modular, the analyses available depend on the modules
    installed. Written by Wayne and David Maddison.</dd>

    <dd>PHYLIP (the PHYLogeny Inference Package) is a package of
    programs for inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees). It is
    available free over the Internet, and written to work on as
    many different kinds of computer systems as possible. The
    source code is distributed (in C), and executables are also
    distributed. In particular, already-compiled executables are
    available for Windows (95/98/NT/2000/me/xp), MacOS 8 and 9,
    MacOS X, and Linux systems. Complete documentation is available
    on documentation files that come with the package.</dd>

    <dd>COMPARE analyzes interspecific data in an evolutionary
    context. It applies several Phylogenetic Comparative Methods
    (e.g., independent contrasts, spatial autocorrelation,
    phylogenetic GLS, phylogenetic mixed model), and can conduct
    phylogenetic randomization tests (i.e., to generate random
    phylogenies, branch lengths, or interspecific data on a
    phylogeny).</dd>

    <dd>CAIC (Comparative Analysis by Independent Contrasts) is a
    freeware comparative analysis package for Macintosh. It and
    finds and calculates phylogenetically independent contrasts in
    one or more variables enabling you to test hypotheses of
    correlated evolution.</dd>

    <dd>MacClade is a computer program for phylogenetic analysis
    written by David Maddison and Wayne Maddison. Its analytical
    strength is in studies of character evolution. It also provides
    many tools for entering and editing data and phylogenies, and
    for producing tree diagrams and charts.</dd>

---

<i>ouch</i> is software for phylogenetic comparative analysis.
It allows one to evaluate hypotheses of evolution of multivariate quantitative characters under selection.
It is fully explained in

    Phylogenetic comparative analysis: a modeling approach for adaptive evolution. 
    <em>American Naturalist</em>, <b>164</b>:683&ndash;695.</dd>

and is based on ideas described in

    Stabilizing selection and the comparative analysis of adaptation. 
    <em>Evolution</em>, <b>51</b>:1341&ndash;1351. </dd>

New results describing the statistical properties of OUCH models, and more complex models based on them, are described in
